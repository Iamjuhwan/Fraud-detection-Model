##  Project Overview
Fraud detection is a critical aspect of financial systems to prevent unauthorized transactions. This project uses various data visualization and statistical techniques to analyze the fraud detection dataset and build a predictive model.

##  Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains transaction details and a target variable indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent. Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA phase involves:

Descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of variables.
Visualization techniques include histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to identify patterns and correlations in the data.
Feature engineering to create new features that may improve the model's performance.

##  Modeling
The project includes the development of a machine-learning model to predict fraudulent transactions. The model is trained using the preprocessed data and evaluated based on various performance metrics.
